#### **Language Translator using Transformers**  
This is a Python-based language translation system using Hugging Face's Transformers. It allows users to translate text between different languages by selecting source and target language codes. The system loads a pre-trained MarianMT model and tokenizes input text for translation.  

### **Features:**  
- Translate text between multiple languages using Helsinki-NLP's MarianMT models.  
- Supports user-defined source and target languages for flexible translation.  
- Utilizes deep learning models from Hugging Face for accurate translations.  
- Efficient text tokenization and generation for smooth performance.  

### **Technologies Used:**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Transformers, Hugging Face, MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer  
- **Concepts:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Translation
